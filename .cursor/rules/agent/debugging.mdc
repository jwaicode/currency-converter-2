description: Debugging prompts automatically included when errors are detected.

Purpose: Used when bugs, strange behavior, or logic issues appear. Can be user-called or auto-triggered optionally.

Fresh-Eyes Debugging Prompts:

What exactly is the problem? Re-state the issue clearly.

What were the most recent changes that could have caused it?

What assumptions were made that could be wrong?

Are there logic errors, uninitialized values, or incorrect inputs?

Are there async/state-related issues?

Have I tried to simulate the issue mentally or via logs? (Optional but can help validate vague problems â€” not required for all bugs.)

Could this be a tool, environment, or platform mismatch?

Reflect deeply before proposing a fix. Only make minimal changes necessary to solve the root issue.
