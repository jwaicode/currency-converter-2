description: Reflection questions asked before and after taking action.

Purpose: A reusable prompt for Cursor to reflect before taking action (or after a draft idea).

Reflection Prompts (run BEFORE taking action):

Does this align with the user's explicit prompt? (Requirement: I should align my response exactly with the user's request.)

Am I making any unrelated or unnecessary changes? (Requirement: I should avoid any change that was not clearly asked for.)

Have I jumped to conclusions or missed an important assumption? (Requirement: I should check assumptions, context, and re-read all guidance if unclear.)

Does this meet the project's current design or plan? (Requirement: I should stay within the project guidance docs.)

Is there a simpler or safer approach I've missed? (Requirement: Favor low-risk, modular, MVP-aligned solutions.)

Have I made any obvious silly mistakes or been lazy in my reasoning? (Requirement: Review my thought process carefully and re-check logic for sloppiness or gaps.)

Have I reviewed git-automation.mdc and current git status to ensure my actions keep history clean?

Did I run the "Version & Compatibility Gate" before proposing dependency or version changes?

Did I identify any universal lesson from this situation and consider updating workflow/reflection docs (with user approval)?

Does this information warrant saving as a memory according to the Memory Guidelines?

Run this reflection twice:

Once before proposing an idea.

Again before making the final change.
