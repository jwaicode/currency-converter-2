Non-Functional Requirements

Performance  
- App should respond to input and state changes within 300ms on mid/low-tier mobile devices.

Offline Support  
- If API fetch fails, app must fall back to previously cached exchange rates.  
- Must not crash or become unusable during API failures or when offline.

Data Constraints  
- Max input length: 12 characters.  
- Gracefully handle inputs that are too long or contain invalid characters.

Scalability (UI)  
- App should perform reasonably even if user adds >20 currencies.

User Feedback  
- A visual indicator should appear if rates are stale (>24h).
