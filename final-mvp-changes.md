""" This final flow will be good experience for my thinking process, how I use cursor (multiple chats/ask other models for fresh eyes/prompt improving ideas/etc), and its an opportunity to utilise a GitHub actions CI to be effective."""

To Do:

- dark theme. just change the colours so its dark, i dont need a toggle between light and dark. 

- currency modal tap away feature. the modal autofocusses on the searchbar, so the keyboard is therefore up and there is part of the curriencies list showing behind the keyboard betweeen the keyboard (bottom) and the searchbar (top); i want to tap anywhere other than the keyboard or search bar and have the search defocus therefore shriking the keyboard back; then the next touch can do anything like scroll the list or just tap a currency. at the moment, the sarch is focussed with the keyboard and tapping away actually selects a currency from the list behind. 

- delete button for each row doesnt do anything. lets diagnose and solve. 

- **also extend currencies.json to all currencies!**

- calculations within input box feature. (a nice-to have extra)


Completely done:

- make caching for offline (!or however id be able to have the app open always if offline, like a native app would - local storage?)



*DONT GET SUCKED INTO ENDLESS IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS AN MVP. DO THE ABOVE LIST TO LEARN AND THEN MOVE ON!*
