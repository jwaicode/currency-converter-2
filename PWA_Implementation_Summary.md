# PWA Implementation Summary

## Task Completed Successfully ✅

Enhanced the `currency-converter-2` project with MVP Progressive Web App functionality, updated cursorrules, and ensured repository cleanliness.

## Implementation Details

### 1. PWA Functionality ✅
- **Expo Configuration**: Created `app.json` with PWA settings and web manifest configuration
- **Web Manifest**: Added `public/manifest.json` for app installation, theming, and standalone mode
- **Service Worker**: Implemented `public/service-worker.js` with basic offline support (MVP approach)
- **HTML Entry Point**: Created `public/index.html` with service worker registration
- **Dependencies**: Updated `package.json` to include `expo-manifests` for PWA support
- **Assets**: Added placeholder icon files (192x192 and 512x512) for PWA installation

### 2. Repository Cleanup ✅
- **Investigation**: Confirmed no `.gitkeep` files exist in the repository (already clean)
- **Prevention**: No cleanup needed as repository was already properly maintained

### 3. Cursorrules Enhancement ✅
- **Updated**: `.cursor/rules/agent/git-automation.mdc` with explicit `.gitkeep` usage and removal guidelines
- **Added Section**: "6. .gitkeep File Usage and Removal Rules" with comprehensive guidelines

### 4. Testing & Verification ✅
- **TypeScript**: Compilation check passed with no errors
- **Dependencies**: Installation completed successfully
- **Service Worker**: Basic offline functionality implemented as requested
- **Configuration**: All PWA files properly structured and accessible

**Service Worker**: Implemented as MVP with basic fetch handling and network fallback, following the exact specification provided in the user prompt.

**PWA Configuration**: Used Expo's built-in PWA support with proper manifest configuration for installability and standalone mode.

**Repository Standards**: Enhanced cursorrules with explicit .gitkeep management guidelines to prevent future accumulation of unnecessary placeholder files.

## Verification Steps for User

1. Navigate to `currency-converter-app` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `expo start --web` to start development server
4. Open browser and check console for service worker registration
5. Test PWA installation prompt and offline functionality
